## Collaboration policy

- Only work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively (Project). 

- Individual assignments (Midterms) must be completed individually, you may not directly share or discuss answers / code with anyone other than the myself.

- On Homeworks you should not directly share answers / code with other teams in this class, however you are welcome to discuss the problems in general and ask for advice.

## Academic integrity

> - I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
> - I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and
> - I will act if the Standard is compromised.

# Course Tools

---

## Jupyter Lab

.center[
.large[Data Science Server - http://datascience.tamucc.edu]
]

- Browser based + Provides consistency in hardware and software environments

- Local Python / Jupyter installations are fine but we will not guarantee support


---

## Local Python + Jupyter

If working locally you should make sure that your environment meets the following requirements:

* Recent Python (3.9 or newer) with working pip (or equivalent)

* Recent jupyterlab (3.2 or newer)

* working git installation ([jupyterlab-git](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git) recoommended)

* ability to create ssh keys (for GitHub authentication)

* Packages updated to their latest version (assignments will include `requirements.txt` when needed)

---

## Username advice

Some brief advice about selecting your account names (particularly for GitHub),

- Incorporate your actual name! People like to know who theyâ€™re dealing with. Also makes your username easier for people to guess or remember.

- Reuse your username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack.

- Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.

- Shorter is better than longer, but be as unique as possible.

- Make it timeless. Avoid highlighting your current university, employer, <br/>or place of residence.

## Git and Gitlab

* make sure you can login in to the https://datascience.tamucc.edu

* make sure you can login in to the https://gitlab2.tamucc.edu

---
## Git basics

* git --version
* git status
* git init

---
## terminals

* cd and cd ..
* touch
* mkdir
* ls


---
## Config git

* git config --global user.name "Zheng Wei"
* git config --global user.email "zheng.wei@tamucc.edu"
* git config --global --list

This will help anyone looking at the changes in the repository see who has made them

---
## git commit

- Main ideas
a commit is a snapshot of the repository at a point in time

steps to create a commit:

* Step 1. create a new file or modify an existing one
* Step 2. stage the file by running git add <FILE NAME>
* Step 3. commit the file by running git commit -m "Message"

---
## git commit

You change some 
* git add
